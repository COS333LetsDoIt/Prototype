<h1> Let's Do It! </h1>

<P> In our hectic lives, students and workers often have erratic schedules, forcing long term planning of social events to be inconvenient. Oftentimes when the rare opportunity of a free moment arises, it can be difficult to see if any fellow students are also available to hang out, grab a meal, or play some sports. At other times, such as before meals, it would be nice to know who else is available to snack with. 
<p>Let's Do It will solve this information gap by making it easy to notify your closest friends when you are or will shortly be free. The app takes into account what you feel like doing and how long you are free for, and provides suggestions for spontaneous meet-ups between you and your friends who are also free at the moment. We aim to target communities who are working or living in close proximity, such as college campuses. Eliminating the awkwardness inherent in last-minute lunch plans and those awkward moments where you are without friends, Let's Do It will allow people to connect people to each other in order to form a closer, happier community.

<P> To start experiencing the joy of spontaneous scheduling brought to you by Let's Do It, click <a href="http://lets-do-it.tk"> http://lets-do-it.tk/</a>.
